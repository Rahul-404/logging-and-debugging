# Python Logging and Debugging Project üêçüõ†Ô∏è

## Overview
Welcome to the Python Logging and Debugging Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for logging and debugging Python projects. By implementing robust logging practices and debugging techniques, developers can effectively monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot issues in their Python code.

## Features
- **Logging Configuration**: Set up logging configuration to capture relevant information, such as log levels, timestamps, and log messages.
- **Custom Logging Handlers**: Implement custom logging handlers to route log messages to different destinations, such as files, databases, or external services.
- **Debugging Tools**: Integrate debugging tools and techniques, such as breakpoints, stack traces, and interactive debugging, to identify and resolve issues efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and errors, preventing application crashes and improving reliability.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor application performance and resource usage to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize code efficiency.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to guide developers in using the logging and debugging features effectively.

## Installation
To use the logging and debugging framework in your Python projects, follow these steps:
1. Install the package using pip:
   ```
   pip install python-logging-debugging
   ```
2. Import the logging and debugging modules into your Python code:
   ```python
   import logging
   import debugging
   ```

## Usage
1. Configure logging settings in your Python application using the provided configuration options.
2. Insert logging statements throughout your code to capture relevant information and track program execution.
3. Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully and log error details for debugging purposes.
4. Use debugging tools such as breakpoints, stack traces, and interactive debugging to diagnose and resolve issues during development and testing.

## Examples
Check out the following examples to see how to use the logging and debugging features in your Python projects:
- `examples/basic_logging.py`: Demonstrates basic logging configuration and usage.
- `examples/custom_handlers.py`: Illustrates how to implement custom logging handlers for different use cases.
- `examples/debugging_tools.py`: Shows how to use debugging tools and techniques to diagnose and fix issues in Python code.
